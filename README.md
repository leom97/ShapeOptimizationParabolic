# Code for my master's thesis

Here I have collected every cooding tool I utilized to run the simulations that are reported in my master's thesis.

The code constantly references the thesis itself, with pointers to sections, figures and tables.

Head to `intructions` for instructions on how to set up your enviroment, in order to be able to execute the code, and for guidance on how to reproduce the results contained in the thesis.
