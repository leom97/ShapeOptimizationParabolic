# Code for my master's thesis

Here I have collected every cooding tool I utilized to run the simulations that are reported in my master's thesis.

The code constantly references the thesis itself, with pointers to sections, figures and tables.

To get this code, perform the following instructions (on Linux):
- clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/leom97/Master-s-thesis.git`
- change the current directory: `cd Master-s-thesis`
- head now to `intructions/environment_setup.md` for instructions on how to set up your enviroment
