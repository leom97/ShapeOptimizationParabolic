# Code for my master's thesis: finite element-based shape optimization with parabolic PDEs

Here I have collected the code I utilized to run the simulations that are reported in my master's thesis.

To obtain the code, perform the following instructions (on Linux):
- clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/leom97/Master-s-thesis.git`
- change the current directory: `cd Master-s-thesis`
- head now to `intructions/environment_setup.md` for instructions on how to set up your enviroment
