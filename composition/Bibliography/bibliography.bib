 abstract = {We derive a posteriori error estimates for the approximation of linear elliptic problems on domains with piecewise smooth boundary. The numerical solution is assumed to be defined on a Finite Element mesh, whose boundary vertices are located on the boundary of the continuous problem. No assumption is made on a geometrically fitting shape. A posteriori error estimates are given in the energy norm and the L2-norm, and efficiency of the adaptive algorithm is proved in the case of a saturated boundary approximation. Furthermore, a strategy is presented to compute the effect of the non-discretized part of the domain on the error starting from a coarse mesh. This especially implies that parts of the domain, where the measured error is small, stay non-discretized. The presented algorithm includes a stable path following to supply a sufficient polygonal approximation of the boundary, the reliable computation of the a posteriori estimates and a mesh adaptation based on Delaunay techniques. Numerical examples illustrate that errors outside the initial discretization will be detected.},

We use an abstract variational setting with time-dependent function spaces and abstract time-dependent finite element spaces. Optimal a priori bounds are shown under usual assumptions on perturbations of bilinear forms and approximation properties of the abstract finite element spaces. The abstract theory is applied to evolving finite elements in both flat and curved spaces. Evolving bulk and surface isoparametric finite element spaces defined on evolving triangulations are defined and developed. These spaces are used to define approximations to parabolic equations in general domains for which the abstract theory is shown to apply. Numerical experiments are described, which confirm the rates of convergence.}",
