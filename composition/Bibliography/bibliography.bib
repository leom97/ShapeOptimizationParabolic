 abstract = {We derive a posteriori error estimates for the approximation of linear elliptic problems on domains with piecewise smooth boundary. The numerical solution is assumed to be defined on a Finite Element mesh, whose boundary vertices are located on the boundary of the continuous problem. No assumption is made on a geometrically fitting shape. A posteriori error estimates are given in the energy norm and the L2-norm, and efficiency of the adaptive algorithm is proved in the case of a saturated boundary approximation. Furthermore, a strategy is presented to compute the effect of the non-discretized part of the domain on the error starting from a coarse mesh. This especially implies that parts of the domain, where the measured error is small, stay non-discretized. The presented algorithm includes a stable path following to supply a sufficient polygonal approximation of the boundary, the reliable computation of the a posteriori estimates and a mesh adaptation based on Delaunay techniques. Numerical examples illustrate that errors outside the initial discretization will be detected.},

Optimal a priori bounds are shown under usual assumptions on perturbations of bilinear forms and approximation properties of the abstract finite element spaces. The abstract theory is applied to evolving finite elements in both flat and curved spaces. Evolving bulk and surface isoparametric finite element spaces defined on evolving triangulations are defined and developed. These spaces are used to define approximations to parabolic equations in general domains for which the abstract theory is shown to apply.

The goal is to determine of the shape of a void or an inclusion of zero temperature from measurements of the temperature and the heat flux at the exterior boundary. This nonlinear and ill-posed shape identification problem is reformulated in terms of three different shape optimization problems: (a) minimization of a least-squares energy variational functional, (b) tracking of the Dirichlet data, and (c) tracking of the Neumann data. The states and their adjoint equations are expressed as parabolic boundary integral equations and solved using a Nyström discretization and a space-time fast multipole method for the rapid evaluation of thermal potentials. Special quadrature rules are derived to handle singularities of the kernel and the solution. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate and compare the different formulations. }

The objective is to detect this inclusion from the given temperature and heat flux at the exterior boundary of the domain.

 abstract = {In this paper we consider a simple finite element method on an approximate polygonal domain using linear elements. The Dirichlet data are transferred in a natural way and the resulting linear system can be solved using multigrid techniques. Our analysis takes into account the change in domain and data transfer, and optimal-error estimates are obtained that are robust in the regularity of the boundary data provided they are at least square integrable. It is proved that the natural extension of our finite element approximation to the original domain is optimal-order accurate.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the convergence of several optimize-then-discretize and discretize-then-optimize algorithms, based on either a second-order or a fourth-order finite difference discretization, for solving elliptic PDE-constrained optimal control problems. To ensure the convergence of a discretize-then-optimize algorithm, one well-accepted criterion is to design the discretization scheme such that the resulting discretize-then-optimize algorithm commutes with the corresponding optimize-then-discretize algorithm. In other words, both algorithms should give rise to exactly the same discrete optimality system. However, such a restrictive criterion is not trivial to fulfill. By investigating a distributed control problem governed by an elliptic equation, we first show that enforcing such a stringent condition of commutative property is only sufficient but not necessary for achieving the desired convergence. We then introduce some suitable H1 semi-norm penalty/regularization terms to recover the lost convergence due to the inconsistency caused by the loss of commutativity. Numerical experiments are carried out to verify our theoretical analysis and also validate the effectiveness of our proposed regularization techniques.}
